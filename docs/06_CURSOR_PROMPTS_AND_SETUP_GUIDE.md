## Prompt 1: Initial Project Setup

### Purpose

This prompt was used to generate the complete NestJS project structure with all modules, entities, and services.

### The Prompt

```
Act as an expert backend developer specializing in NestJS, blockchain integration, and microservice architecture.

Your task is to generate a complete, production-ready, and scalable NestJS project based on the detailed scope document provided below. The project should follow NestJS best practices, including a modular structure, clear separation of concerns, and robust error handling.

Please generate the entire project, including the file structure and the code for each file.

Project Name: b3tr-rewards-api

1. Core Project Setup
Framework: Use the latest stable version of NestJS.
Language: TypeScript.
Package Manager: Use pnpm or npm.
Database ORM: Use TypeORM to connect with the PostgreSQL database.
Configuration: Use the @nestjs/config module for environment variable management (.env file).
Validation: Use class-validator and class-transformer for all DTOs.
API Documentation: Integrate nestjs/swagger and add decorators (@ApiOperation, @ApiResponse, @ApiTags, @ApiProperty) to all controllers and DTOs to automatically generate OpenAPI documentation.

2. Detailed Project Structure & Modules
Please generate the following modular structure inside the src/ directory. For each module, create the standard NestJS files: module.ts, controller.ts, service.ts, and corresponding DTO and Entity folders.

a. app.module.ts (Root Module)
Import all feature modules.
Configure ConfigModule.forRoot({ isGlobal: true }).
Configure TypeOrmModule.forRootAsync({}) to read database credentials from environment variables.
Configure ScheduleModule.forRoot() for cron jobs.

b. auth Module
Goal: Handle wallet-based authentication.
Controller:
POST /auth/login: Takes a signed message and wallet address.
POST /auth/logout: Invalidates the session.
Service:
Implement logic to verify a VeChain wallet signature.
Generate a JWT (@nestjs/jwt) upon successful validation.
Strategy: Use @nestjs/passport with a custom WalletStrategy for signature verification and a JwtStrategy to protect authenticated routes.

c. users and tiers Modules
Goal: Manage user profiles and their tier status.
Entities:
User Entity: id, walletAddress (unique), email (optional), tierId, createdAt. Relations: one-to-many with Vehicles, one-to-one with UserStats.
Tier Entity: id, name, minDistance, minUploads, storeDiscountPercentage.
UserStats Entity: totalKilometers, totalUploads, currentStreak.
users Service: Basic CRUD for user profiles, logic to update user stats.
tiers Service: Logic to check and assign a user to a tier based on their stats. This should be called by the weekly cron job.

d. vehicles Module
Goal: Manage user vehicles.
Entity: Vehicle Entity: id, userId, type (enum: SCOOTER, BIKE, SUV, etc.), numberPlate (optional, encrypted), createdAt. Relation: many-to-one with User.
Controller: CRUD endpoints for vehicles, protected by the JWT guard.

e. odometer Module
Goal: Handle odometer photo uploads and OCR processing.
Controller:
POST /odometer/upload: Accepts multipart/form-data with an image file and vehicleId.
Service (OdometerService):
Receive the image buffer.
Pass the buffer to a separate OcrService.
Receive the extracted mileage and a confidence score from OcrService.
If confidence is low, throw a BadRequestException.
If high, pass the data to the MileageLogService.
Service (OcrService):
Create a placeholder service with a method extractMileage(image: Buffer): Promise<{ mileage: number; confidence: number; }>. Simulate a delay and return a mock value. This is where TensorFlow.js logic would go.

f. mileage-logs Module
Goal: Validate and store mileage history.
Entity: MileageLog Entity: id, vehicleId, mileage, carbonOffset, isVerified, createdAt.
Service:
createLog(vehicleId, newMileage):
Fetch the latest log for the vehicleId.
Validation: Throw an error if newMileage is less than or equal to the last recorded mileage (regressive/duplicate check).
Flag unusually large spikes for admin review.
Calculate the distance traveled (newMileage - lastMileage).
Calculate COâ‚‚ saved based on vehicle type (create a constants file for emission factors).
Save the new MileageLog.
Update the UserStats for the user.

g. rewards and leaderboard Modules
Goal: Manage scoring, leaderboards, and token distribution.
Entities:
Leaderboard Entity: id, userId, weeklyScore, rank, round.
RewardPool Entity: id, totalAmount, distributedAmount, round.
leaderboard Service: Logic to calculate scores (total valid km) and update ranks.
rewards Service:
Logic to calculate the token payout for each user based on their leaderboard rank and the 75/25 split.
Interact with the VeChainService to trigger the smart contract payout.

h. blockchain Module
Goal: Abstract all VeChain interactions.
Service (VeChainService):
Use thor-devkit to interact with the VeChainThor network.
constructor(): Initialize connection to a VeChain node (URL from .env).
triggerBatchPayout(payouts: { recipient: string; amount: string }[]):
Placeholder function to demonstrate how you would call a smart contract function (e.g., batchPay).
Use an admin/organization wallet private key (from .env) to sign the transaction.

i. badges Module
Goal: Manage the badge achievement system.
Entities:
Badge Entity: id, name, description, imageUrl, conditions (JSONB), isPublished.
UserBadge Entity: id, userId, badgeId, earnedAt.
Service:
Logic to evaluate if a user meets badge conditions after a relevant action (e.g., after a mileage log is created).
A method checkAllUsersForBadge(badgeId) for manual awarding.
Implement the edit/publish logic: a badge's conditions can only be edited if isPublished is false or if no UserBadge entries exist for it.

j. store Module
Goal: Manage the token redemption store.
Entities:
Product Entity: id, name, description, priceInBTR, stock.
Order Entity: id, userId, productId, amountPaid, status (enum: PENDING, SHIPPED).
Controller: Endpoints to list products and create an order.
Service: Logic to handle redemptions, checking user token balance (this would be a call to the VeChain service to check a contract state), applying tier discounts, and updating stock.

k. admin Module
Goal: Provide administrative functionalities.
Controller:
Create a separate controller with the /admin prefix.
Protect all endpoints with a RoleGuard (only role: 'admin').
Endpoints to manage users, view logs, create/edit badges and tiers, and manage store products.
Service: Business logic for the admin operations.

l. scheduling Module
Goal: House all scheduled tasks (cron jobs).
Service (TasksService):
Use the @Cron() decorator from @nestjs/schedule.
Weekly Leaderboard Cron (@Cron(CronExpression.SUNDAY_AT_MIDNIGHT)):
Call leaderboardService.calculateScoresForCurrentRound().
Call rewardsService.distributeRewards().
Call tierService.updateAllUserTiers().
Reset weekly scores for the new round.
