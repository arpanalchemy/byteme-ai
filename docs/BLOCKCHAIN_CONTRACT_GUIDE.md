# Blockchain Contract Guide - EV Odometer Rewards System

## Non-Technical Overview

## üéØ What is a Blockchain Contract?

Think of a blockchain contract like a **digital vending machine** that automatically works without needing a person to operate it. Once set up, it follows specific rules and cannot be changed or tampered with.

### Simple Analogy:

- **Traditional System**: Like a bank where a person manually transfers money between accounts
- **Blockchain Contract**: Like a vending machine that automatically gives you a snack when you put in the right amount of money

## üöó How Our EV Rewards Contract Works

### The Big Picture

Our blockchain contract is like a **digital rewards bank** that:

1. **Stores B3TR tokens** (our reward currency)
2. **Automatically distributes rewards** when users upload odometer photos
3. **Keeps track of all transactions** in a transparent, unchangeable record
4. **Works 24/7** without human intervention

### Step-by-Step Process

#### 1. **User Uploads Photo** üì∏

- User takes photo of their EV odometer
- AI system verifies the mileage reading
- System calculates how many B3TR tokens they should receive

#### 2. **Contract Receives Request** ‚ö°

- Our backend system sends a request to the blockchain contract
- Request includes: user's wallet address + amount of B3TR to send

#### 3. **Contract Validates** ‚úÖ

- Contract checks if the request is valid
- Verifies we have enough B3TR tokens to distribute
- Ensures user hasn't exceeded daily/weekly limits

#### 4. **Automatic Distribution** üí∞

- Contract automatically sends B3TR tokens to user's wallet
- Transaction is recorded permanently on the blockchain
- User receives tokens instantly

#### 5. **Transparent Record** üìã

- Every transaction is visible to everyone
- No one can change or delete the records
- Complete audit trail for compliance

## üè¶ The B3TR Token System

### What is B3TR?

- **B3TR** is our custom reward token (like digital points)
- **1 B3TR = 1 token** (similar to how 1 dollar = 1 dollar)
- **Limited supply** - we create a fixed amount and distribute them
- **Valuable** - users can trade, sell, or use them for rewards

### Token Distribution Rules

```
Reward Calculation:
- 1 B3TR = 10 kilometers driven
- Example: 50 km = 5 B3TR tokens

Daily Limits:
- Maximum 100 B3TR per day per user
- Prevents abuse and ensures fair distribution

Weekly Limits:
- Maximum 500 B3TR per week per user

Monthly Limits:
- Maximum 2000 B3TR per month per user
```

## üîê Security & Trust Features

### Why Blockchain is Secure

1. **No Single Point of Failure**

   - Not controlled by one person or company
   - Multiple computers verify every transaction

2. **Transparent & Auditable**

   - Everyone can see all transactions
   - No hidden fees or secret transfers

3. **Immutable Records**

   - Once recorded, transactions cannot be changed
   - Perfect for compliance and auditing

4. **Automated Execution**
   - No human error or manipulation
   - Rules are programmed and cannot be bypassed

### Fraud Prevention

- **Duplicate Detection**: Same photo cannot be used twice
- **Time Limits**: Users cannot upload multiple times in short periods
- **AI Verification**: Photos are verified by artificial intelligence
- **Manual Review**: Suspicious uploads are flagged for human review

## üí∞ Token Economics

### Initial Token Supply

```
Total B3TR Supply: 1,000,000 tokens
Distribution Plan:
- 60% (600,000) - User rewards pool
- 20% (200,000) - Platform operations
- 15% (150,000) - Team and development
- 5% (50,000) - Community incentives
```

### Token Value Creation

1. **Scarcity**: Limited supply makes tokens valuable
2. **Utility**: Tokens can be used for rewards and services
3. **Demand**: More users = more demand for tokens
4. **Sustainability**: Rewards promote eco-friendly driving

## üöÄ Deployment Phases

### Phase 1: Testnet (Development)

- **Purpose**: Testing the contract before real money
- **Duration**: 2-4 weeks
- **Risk**: None - using test tokens
- **Goal**: Ensure everything works perfectly

### Phase 2: Mainnet (Live)

- **Purpose**: Real deployment with actual B3TR tokens
- **Duration**: Permanent
- **Risk**: Low - thoroughly tested
- **Goal**: Launch rewards system for users
